| 1   | An insidious crack runs through this placeâ€”dark energy emanating from it.                |
| 2   | A magical frost covers many surfaces. It's cool to the touch but doesn't melt.           |
| 3   | Parchment and scraps of scrolls are strewn about this location.                          |
| 4   | Blackened marks scorch the surfaces of this place. A trap triggered or spell gone wrong? |
| 5   | Light refracts strangely in this place, casting shadow patterns you wouldn't expect.     |
| 6   | Echoes of an ancient ritual hum here as if in song.                                      |
| 7   | Eldritch runes appear on surfaces at random before quickly disappearing.                 |
| 8   | A distant bell sounds at regular intervals. And they're getting shorter.                 |
| 9   | A magical fire still burns here. It gives off no heat.                                   |
| 10  | A pillar has burst through the ground. Upon it, arcane runes thrum with energy.          |
