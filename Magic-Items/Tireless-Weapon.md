# Tireless Weapon

*Legendary (10,000 gp)* *Requires Attunement*

Each time you would suffer one level of exhaustion while attuned to this weapon, you gain no levels of exhaustion. Instead, the weapon gains two levels of exhaustion. The weapon suffers no penalties as a result of the exhaustion.

When your attunement to the weapon ends, you instantly gain all levels of exhaustion from the weapon and suffer their normal effects.
