# RPG Resource Repository

RPG resources for tabletop roleplaying games like Dungeons & Dragons. At the time of writing this, you'll find generic (ex. random tables) and 5E (ex. backgrounds, feats, etc) resources. For the latter, I try to target 2024 rules, where possible. 

Use this material for inspiration or wholesale in accordance with the licensing granted below. If you decide to use it for any commercial products, please consider reaching out to let me know. I always enjoy seeing how the material is used and I'd be happy to support your project. ❤️
