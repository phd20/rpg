# Architect

> “Our designs are more than a structure—the spaces within are an experience. That experience can be one of solitude, sadness, and secrecy. But it can also be one of beauty, communion, and life.”

Your life has been one of broad study with the focus of bringing it all together in architecture. You design and understand spaces and their experiences. You might have studied under a master architect in a great city. Or you might have just been blessed with an attunement to space and design. You seek out the known and unknown masterpieces of architecture within the world.
