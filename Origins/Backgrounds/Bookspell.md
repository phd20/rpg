# Bookspell

> “Books are our past, present, and future. They open doors to other worlds to help us clearly see and understand our own. Books are worth more than gems and great works of art. Books are magic.”

You spent your life surrounded by books. You know how to care for them, organize them, and share them with the world. Reading is but a fraction of your craft. You might have studied at a great university or simply acquired the skill and knowledge from a local bookshop. But books reveal their secrets to you and you share their beauty with the world.
